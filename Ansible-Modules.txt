1. localhost -> within ansible host server if you want to install any package then under hosts section we need to give localhost.

ex:

hosts: localhost

2. How to install package in remote server?

-> under hosts section we need to give remote server Ip address or we need to provide name of the remote server.

ex:

hosts: 192.168.33.11
(or)
hosts: devserver


tasks:

to perform any action.

ex: if I want to install java in centos server?

tasks:
-name: install java in centos server

-> In one playbook will use multiple tasks, we don't have any limit.

ex: 

tasks:
- name: install java in centos

- name: install jenkins in centos

- name: install ec2 instance in aws account.

write a playbook install java? 

- if there is no any remote server details then we need to execute the plabyook in ansible hostserver.
for that we need to give 
    hosts: localhost

note: if you give hosts as localhost the script will execute in ansible host server.








write a playbook install java in remote server 192.168.33.13?


- if we have  remote server details then we need to execute the plabyook in ansible remote server.
for that we need to give 
    hosts: server ip address or go to 
            ->   /etec/ansible and open hosts file give any name like 
                 [java]
                  192.168.33.13

       - now we need to give hosts: java
    
Note: let say I have 5 ansible remote server that time will follow below method.

go to /etc/ansible 
vim hosts
[java]
192.168.33.10
192.168.33.11
192.168.33.12
192.168.33.13
192.168.33.14
192.168.33.15
